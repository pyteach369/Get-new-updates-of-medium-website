pyteach

0- open a terminal in that directory
1- type -> "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install libraries
2- write your topic in questions.txt like I wrote
3- run -> "python main.py"
Note: you can put it in your startup folder. from now on , every time you restart your computer you will get the new updates about what are you looking for

for avoiding being block by google , I wrote it in a way that if you run it now, untill 1 hour later it will show you the same result( it mean untill 1 hour later
the program will not request google again )
